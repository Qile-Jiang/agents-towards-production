# Contextual AI: Build Production-Ready RAG Agents in 15 Minutes

Want to take advantage of your data, but don't want to reinvent RAG infrastructure? You can deploy Agentic RAG in minutes using Contextual AI's managed RAG solution.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

**Contextual AI** provides a complete, modular developer platform for building powerful **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** agents with state-of-the-art components and exceptional out-of-the-box performance. This tutorial demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for creating a RAG agent for financial use cases. The agent answers questions based on provided documents, synthesizing information across multiple sources without adding its own perspective.

## ðŸ“š What is in this tutorial?

This notebook covers the following basic steps of building a RAG agent with Contextual's API:
- **Creating a Datastore**
- **Ingesting Documents**
- **Creating an RAG Agent**
- **Querying an RAG Agent**
- **Evaluating an RAG Agent**

Then we will also explore Contextual AI's powerful modular components:
- **Document Parser**: Enterprise-grade parser that understands document hierarchies across hundreds of pages, minimizes hallucinations, and handles complex modalities like tables, charts, and figures
- **Instruction-Following Reranker**: The world's most accurate reranker that follows custom instructions to resolve conflicting information and prioritize documents based on recency, source, metadata, and domain-specific requirements
- **Grounded Language Model (GLM)**: The most grounded language model optimized for RAG use cases, providing inline source attributions and minimizing hallucinations by prioritizing retrieved knowledge over parametric knowledge
- **LMUnit**: Language model optimized for evaluating natural language unit tests, enabling fine-grained evaluation and production-ready testing with strong human alignment and actionable insights

Finally, we will demonstrate how to use Contextual AI's MCP server that acts as a bridge between many different AI interfaces (like OpenAI, Cursor IDE or Claude Desktop) and a specialized Contextual AI agent.
